# Underdiagnosis of Endometriosis

## Overview
Endometriosis affects a significant proportion of women, yet remains widely underdiagnosed. This project explores evidence of underdiagnosis by examining symptom burden, hormonal abnormalities, and diagnosis status using structured survey data.

Rather than attempting diagnosis or prediction, the analysis focuses on identifying **mismatches between symptom severity and clinical recognition**.

## Dataset
- Structured endometriosis survey dataset
- Features include age, chronic pain level, menstrual irregularity, hormonal abnormality, BMI, infertility status, and diagnosis label
- Dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing constraints

## Analysis Highlights
- High chronic pain levels observed among undiagnosed individuals
- Hormonal abnormalities present without formal diagnosis
- Menstrual irregularities frequently dismissed
- Evidence of systemic underrecognition rather than absence of symptoms

## Ethics & Limitations
- This analysis is not diagnostic
- Findings are limited by survey-based data and lack of diagnostic timeline variables
- Results emphasize the need for better clinical data collection rather than automated diagnosis

## Tools
Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
